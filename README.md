CIFAR-10 Image Classification. The purpose of the project is to train a model to classify ten different objects(airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck). Then use the trained model to predict input image file and classify object in the image to one of the ten objects.

The structure of the project will be a front end folder which is using React, a machine learning project which will be done by pytorch to train the model and generate the model, and a backend folder which will be using Flask python.
